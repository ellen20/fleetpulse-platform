## 📸 Overview

FleetPulse is a full-stack portfolio project demonstrating real-world QA engineering practices — including contract testing with Pact, end-to-end testing with Playwright, and comprehensive E2E testing with Cypress across both the dashboard and driver applications.

**Fleet Map Tab** — Live vehicle locations, status filtering, charging station visibility, paginated vehicle list

**Assignments Tab** — Assign drivers to vehicles, cancel pending assignments, view driver contact details

**Driver App** — Driver-facing portal with PIN authentication, trip status, and assignment management

---

## ✨ Features

- 🗺️ **Interactive Fleet Map** — SVG map with color-coded vehicle pins and live status
- 📋 **Assignment Management** — Full workflow: assign → pending → active → cancel
- ⚡ **Charging Station Monitor** — Port availability and power output per station
- 🔄 **Status Filtering** — Filter by available / charging / maintenance
- 🚫 **Double-Booking Prevention** — Database transactions prevent duplicate assignments
- 🔁 **Auto-Refresh** — Data refreshes every 10 seconds
- 📄 **Pagination** — Vehicle list shows 10 per page
- 🔐 **Authentication** — Session-based login with protected routes and logout
- 🛡️ **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** — Manager can assign/cancel; Viewer has read-only access enforced in UI
- 🐳 **Docker Support** — One-command setup with docker-compose

## 🧪 Testing

### E2E Tests (Cypress) — 80+ tests

Both the dashboard and driver app must be running before executing Cypress tests.

```bash
# Install Cypress
npm install cypress --save-dev

# Open Cypress Test Runner (interactive)
npx cypress open

# Run all tests headlessly
npx cypress run

# Run a specific file
npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/rbac.cy.js"
```

#### Test credentials are managed centrally in `cypress/fixtures/users.json`
#### Reusable `cy.loginAs('manager')` and `cy.loginAs('viewer')` custom commands

---

#### auth.cy.js — 9 tests
- ✅ Login page renders correctly
- ✅ Demo credentials fill form on click
- ✅ Password toggle shows and hides password
- ✅ Invalid credentials show error message
- ✅ Empty fields show error message
- ✅ Manager can login and reach dashboard
- ✅ Viewer can login and reach dashboard
- ✅ Logout redirects to login page
- ✅ Authenticated user redirected away from login page

#### dashboard.cy.js — 14 tests
- ✅ Header branding and navigation buttons
- ✅ Vehicle and driver count displayed
- ✅ Logged in user name displayed in header
- ✅ Logout button redirects to login
- ✅ All four stat cards visible
- ✅ Total fleet equals sum of all statuses (business logic validation)
- ✅ Stat cards persist on Assignments view
- ✅ Default shows all vehicles with pagination
- ✅ Status filtering: Available, Charging, Maintenance
- ✅ Pagination page 2 loads remaining vehicles

#### assignments.cy.js — 14 tests
- ✅ Assignment management header visible
- ✅ All required table columns present
- ✅ All vehicles displayed in table
- ✅ At least one action button visible
- ✅ Fleet map elements hidden on assignments tab
- ✅ Assign button opens driver selection modal
- ✅ Modal shows available drivers only
- ✅ Modal shows driver details (email, phone, license)
- ✅ Closing modal with X dismisses it
- ✅ Assigning a driver closes the modal
- ✅ Cancel shows confirmation dialog
- ✅ Confirming cancel removes the assignment
- ✅ Driver contact modal opens and shows details
- ✅ Active assignment warning shown in contact modal

#### rbac.cy.js — 12 tests
- ✅ Manager can see Assign button for available vehicles
- ✅ Manager can see Cancel button for pending assignments
- ✅ Manager can open driver selection modal
- ✅ Manager does not see "View only" text
- ✅ Manager name displayed in header
- ✅ Viewer cannot see Assign button
- ✅ Viewer cannot see Cancel button
- ✅ Viewer sees "View only" text instead of action buttons
- ✅ Viewer can still see all vehicles in table
- ✅ Viewer can still filter vehicles by status
- ✅ Viewer name displayed in header
- ✅ Viewer can logout successfully

#### driver-app.cy.js — 20+ tests
- ✅ Login page UI and branding
- ✅ Form validation and disabled button states
- ✅ Invalid credentials error handling
- ✅ Successful login and dashboard redirect
- ✅ Driver dashboard: greeting, date, trip status
- ✅ Current assignments display and refresh
- ✅ Logout and session clearing

#### api-errors.cy.js — 15+ tests
- ✅ Zero counts shown when vehicles API fails
- ✅ Dashboard layout intact on API failure
- ✅ HTTP 500 and 404 errors handled gracefully
- ✅ Partial API failure: app stable when individual endpoints fail
- ✅ Slow API response: 3 second delay stability test
- ✅ Page refresh recovery after API comes back online
- ✅ Driver app: login, dashboard, and refresh failure handling

---

### Security & Auth Tests

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- ✅ Login flow with valid/invalid credentials
- ✅ Protected route enforcement — unauthenticated redirect
- ✅ RBAC validation — manager vs viewer role access enforced in UI
- ✅ Session persistence and logout clearing

> **Future Improvement:** API error tests will be expanded once error message UI (toast notifications, retry buttons, loading spinners) is implemented.

---

### E2E Tests (Playwright)

```bash
# From project root - backend + frontend must be running
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
npx playwright test
```

**Covers:**
- ✅ Full assignment creation workflow
- ✅ Cancel pending assignment
- ✅ Fleet Map displays correctly after assignment

### Contract Tests (Pact)

```bash
# Step 1: Generate pact file (consumer side)
cd dashboard
npm run test:pact

# Step 2: Verify against running API (provider side)
cd api
npm run test:pact:verify
```

**Contracts verified:**
- ✅ `GET /api/drivers` — returns array with correct fields
- ✅ `GET /api/vehicles` — returns array with correct fields
- ✅ `POST /api/assignments` — creates with snake_case fields, returns pending status

### CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

Cypress tests run automatically on every push and pull request to `main`:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
```

- ✅ PostgreSQL service spun up automatically
- ✅ Database initialized and seeded
- ✅ API server started
- ✅ Dashboard built and served
- ✅ Cypress tests executed headlessly
- ✅ Screenshots uploaded on failure

---

## 🛡️ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

FleetPulse enforces two roles in the dashboard:

| Feature | Manager | Viewer |
|---------|---------|--------|
| View fleet map | ✅ | ✅ |
| View vehicle list | ✅ | ✅ |
| View stat cards | ✅ | ✅ |
| Filter by status | ✅ | ✅ |
| View assignments table | ✅ | ✅ |
| View driver contact info | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Assign driver to vehicle** | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Cancel pending assignment** | ✅ | ❌ |

**Demo credentials:**
| Role | Email | Password |
|------|-------|----------|
| Manager | manager@fleetpulse.com | manager123 |
| Viewer | viewer@fleetpulse.com | viewer123 |

---

## 🗄️ Data Model

### Vehicle Status (Physical State)
| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `available` | Ready to be assigned |
| `charging` | At a charging station |
| `maintenance` | Out of service |

### Assignment Status (Operational State)
| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `pending` | Assigned by manager, awaiting driver |
| `active` | Driver accepted, trip in progress |
| `completed` | Trip finished |
| `cancelled` | Assignment cancelled |

> A vehicle can be `charging` AND have a `pending` assignment — physical state and operational state are intentionally separate.

---

## 🔒 Environment Variables

Create `api/.env` based on `api/.env.example`:

```bash
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=fleetpulse
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
PORT=3001
```
